      <p>Howard Darmstadter’s <a class="a-link"

				 target="_blank">Precision’s Counterfeit</a> reads like both a <a class="footnote">clarion call<span> “there’s got to be

	    possible idea: don’t repeat yourself”</span></a> by someone who,
	being a lawyer not a programmer, has no exposure to the
	disciplines and possibilities of software engineering and
	language design. Indeed, he talks about debugging contracts
	as programs; he talks about testing; he talks about using
	mathematical notation, even flowcharts, to improve
	clarity. But as a lawyer he doesn’t know where to go next
	with these ideas. Lawyers don’t get CLE / professional
	credits for reading <a class="a-link"

					 href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Process_Modeling_Language"
					 target="_blank">BPML</a>, whose history has much to
	teach. Yet contracts are, effectively, business process
	specifications, where they skip over the high-level
	modelling and go straight to writing a low-level runtime by
	hand … using a collaboration methodology that could only be
	described as <em>pair programming by correspondence</em>,
	the way <a class="a-link"
		   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Correspondence_Chess_Championship"
		   target="_blank">chess used to be played</a> during the Cold
	War.</p>
      <p>In that paper, Darmstadter:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>describes the problem without knowing its name when he suggests that contracts should try to specify <em>why</em> before implementing <em>how</em>; then</li>
	<li>alludes to <a class="a-link"

	  code.</li></ul>
      <p>The paper is a fun (and cringe-inducing) read. But the current state of the art is all <em>quite</em> ghastly, isn't it?</p>

	design than a web page</h2>
      <p>The legal informatics tradition is older than most web
	developers today. Most web developers are used to playing
	with tech that’s only been around a few months, maybe a
	year. For these, quick hacks are good enough – after all,
	what’s the worst that could happen? Reload the page, if it
	didn’t work, it’ll be obvious.</p>
      <p>Contracts are different: &nbsp;once executed, they don’t
	change.
	<br>
	They aren't like web pages where the odd JS bug is
	acceptable. &nbsp; Parties can turn hostile – as <a class="a-link"
							    href="http://pastebin.com/CcGUBgDG" target="_blank">TheDAO</a>
	discovered. &nbsp; The stakes, permanency, and failure costs of
	contracts suggests that it has more in common with processor
	design than a web page.  So <em>move fast and break things</em>
	does not apply.
