      <h2>Hello! We are so chuffed to have you with us.</h2>
      <p>This <a class="footnote">Privacy Policy<span>that is, the
	    whole body of this document you are reading right now, as may
	    be amended from time to time</span></a> applies to our website, web
	applications, platform, services, community / developer
	resources, and products as provided at <a class="a-link"
						  href="https://legalese.com" target="blank">legalese.com</a>
	(each a "<b>Product</b>", and collectively, the
	“<b>Products</b>”).</p>

      <p>There are many ways that you can use our Products.<br>
        We understand and appreciate that when you use our Products
        you may share information with us. Sharing your information
        may help us make our Products even better –– for instance,
        to show you more relevant search results, to show you more
        appropriate smart defaults, to make sharing with others
        quicker and easier, etc. 
      <p>That said, your privacy and preferences are important to us. So whether you are new to us
	or a long-time user, <a class="a-link"
				href="mailto:support@legalese.com?subject=Uhm, about your
				      Privacy Policy&CC=clause@legalese.com">please feel free to
	  reach out</a> should you have any questions.</p><br>


      <h2>First things first</h2>
      <h3>Read this with the terms of use</h3>
      <p>This Privacy Policy complements
	our <a class="a-link" href="terms.html" target="_blank">Terms of
	  Use</a>. This means they are to be read together. We urge you to
	also familiarise yourself with both of them and all other documents that they may reference.</p>
      <p>This Privacy Policy is intended to help you understand what
        information we collect, how we might use it, and what choices
        you have with regard such information. </p>
      <p><b>By using our Product(s), you consent to the collection
          and use of information by us as set out in
          this Privacy Policy.</b></p>
      
      <h3>Navigating this document</h3>

	amended from time to time).</p>

      <br>	  
      <h2>Information that we collect</h2>
      <p>We collect information in a bid to better understand our Products
	and users (like you) so that we may then provide better Products

      <p>We collect the following kind of information:</p>
      <ul>
	<li> <b>Information you give us</b><br>
          <p>This could be <a class="footnote">Personal Data<span>That

	    </ul>
	</li>
	
	<li><b>Information we get from your use of
	    Products</b><br>We
	  collect <a class="footnote">information about the Products that you use and how you use them<span>This includes

	      interaction with our Products, browsing history, searches,
	      documents, and other content hosted by us or on our

	      through out system.</span></a>. We have systems set up to
	  analyse and process such information as they are sent, received, and
	  when they are stored. Such information is classified as
	  non-personal information as it is collected in a form that
	  does not, on its own, permit direct association with any
	  specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer, and
	  disclose such non-personal information for any
	  purpose. The following are some examples of non-personal

          <ul><li><a class="footnote">device information<span><b>device
		    information</b> means information that is specific to the
		  device you used to access the Product(s). For example:&nbsp

		  automatically record the page requests made when you visit our
		  sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request,
		  Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the

		  uniquely identify your browser.</span></a></li>

            <li><a class="footnote">location information<span><b>location

      <h2>How we use information that we collect</h2>
      <p>If you do not want us to use your information in any of the
	way(s) described in this Privacy
	Policy, please <a class="a-link" href="mailto:support@legalese.com">let us
	  know immediately</a>.</p>
      
      <p>We use the information that we collect so that we can
	provide the Products to you and enhance your experience of
	the Products. We may also personalize your repeat visits in
	a bid to make the process more seamless and tailored to your
	needs. We may use your <a class="footnote">Personal
	  Data<span>That is, data that personally identifies the
	    person in question (in this case, you). For instance, your
	    name, email address, or credit card details.</span></a> to
	contact you and, if you agree, to enable our affiliates or
	partners to contact you.</p>

      <ul><li>For example (but not by way of limitation), we may
	  contact you to give you notices about your account, site
	  updates, new services and features or to fulfil the
	  purpose of a Product feature.</li></ul>

      <h3>According to your account preferences</h3>
      <p>Information you post or share on or via our Products may be
	shared with others according to the account preferences associated
	with that particular account. By default, this would be the
	default account preferences settings when you first created an
	account with us. These account preferences may be updated by you
	at a later time under your personal or company settings options;
	they may also be set by administrator(s) of any linked accounts of
	yours. Your profile may be visible to others in accordance with
	these settings. We cannot guarantee the security of any
	information you publicly disclose online; this means that you must
	make any such disclosures at your own risk.</p>

      <h3>Non-personal information and/or anonymous data</h3>
      <p>We may use non-personal information and/or anonymous data collected from you or your use of the
	Products for site administration, analytics, advertising and
	promotional purposes, and we may share such information with
	other entities (such as service providers) for such
	purposes. We may also aggregate data to enable research or
	analysis so that we can better understand and serve you and
	others.</p>
      <ul>
	<li>For example (but not by way of limitation), we may
	  conduct research on your demographics and usage. Although
	  this aggregated data may be based in part
	  on <a class="footnote">Personal Data<span>That is, data that
	      identifies a single person in question (in this case,
	      you). For instance, your name, email address, or credit card
	      details.</span></a>, it does not identify you
	  personally.</li></ul>
      <p>We may share this type of anonymous data with others,
	including service providers, our affiliates, agents and
	current and prospective business partners. We may use your
	anonymous data outside of Legalese to improve third party
	marketing or use your data in combination with third party
	data to improve your experiences both in and outside
	Legalese. We may retain your IP address and/or other
	device-identifying data in order to help us diagnose
	problems with our servers, to administer our Products
	including personalizing content or links relevant to your
	geographic area or device-type, to verify that your account
	is not being used by others, to gather broad anonymous
	demographic data (such as the number of visitors from a
	geographic area), to enforce compliance with
	our <a class="a-link" href="terms.html"
	       target="_blank">Terms of Use</a> or otherwise in order to
	protect our Products, users, customers, or such other third
	parties.</p>
      <p>We may use analysis tools such as Google Analytics. These provide us with information about how our users use the Products.</p>

      <br>
      <h2>Control you have over our use</h2>
      <p>You may delete your account at any time – this will remove your account page from our Product(s). We do not guarantee the ability to delete all stored data.</p>
      <p>If you would like us to
	delete/correct <a class="footnote">Personal Data<span>That is,
	    data that personally identifies the person in question (in this
	    case, you). For instance, your name, email address, or credit card
	    details.</span></a>, let us know and we will act on your request
	as soon as reasonably practicable.</p>
      <p>Your account information will be protected by a password for
	your privacy and security. You have the responsibility of
	preventing unauthorized access to your account and personal data
	by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and
	limiting access to your computer or device and by signing off
	after you have finished accessing your account.</p>
      <p>You can access information associated with your account by logging into your account with us.</p>

      <br>
      <h2>Sharing your data with third parties</h2>
      <p>We may share anonymouse data with third parties to, for
	example (but not by way of limitation), improve Legalese,
	the Products, and to enable data aggregation as described
	above.</p>
      <p>Where necessary, we may share
	your <a class="footnote">Personal Data<span>That is, data
	    that personally identifies a single person in question (in this
	    case, you). For instance, your name, email address, or
	    credit card details.</span></a>, with our independent
	contractors, subcontractors, service providers, or
	affiliates (in each case, subject to confidentiality
	obligations).</p>
      <p>We may also share <a class="footnote">Personal
	  Data<span>That is, data that personally identifies a single
	    person in question (in this case, you). For instance, your
	    name, email address, or credit card details.</span></a> with
	interested parties in the event that we anticipate a change
	in control or the acquisition of all or part of our business
	or assets or with interested parties in connection with the
	use or rights in respect of our technology.</p>
      <p>If Legalese is sold or makes a sale or transfer, we may,
	in our sole discretion, transfer, sell or assign your
	personal data to a third party as part of or in connection
	with that transaction. Upon such transfer, the privacy
	policy of the acquiring entity may govern the further use of
	your personal data. In all other situations your data will
	still remain protected in accordance with
	this <a class="footnote">Privacy Policy<span>that is, the
	    whole body of this document you are reading right now, as
	    may be amended from time to time</span></a>.</p>
      <p>We may share your <a class="footnote">Personal Data<span>That is,
	    data that personally identifies a single person in question

	for legal reasons or in order to enforce
	our <a class="a-link" href="terms.html"
	       target="_blank">Terms of Use</a> or
	this <a class="footnote">Privacy Policy<span>that is, the
	    whole body of this document you are reading right now, as

      <br>
      <h2>How we protect your data</h2>
      <p>We care a great deal about keeping your data secure and
	protecting it from inappropriate disclosure. This is why we
	implement a variety of security measures to ensure the
	security of your <a class="footnote">Personal
	  Data <span>That is, data that personally identifies a single
	    person in question (in this case, you). For instance, your
	    name, email address, or credit card details.</span></a>on
	our systems. Any <a class="footnote">Personal Data<span>That
	    is, data that personally identifies a single person in
	    question (in this case, you). For instance, your name, email
	    address, or credit card details.</span></a> collected by us
	is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible
	by a limited number of Legalese personnel who have special
	access rights to such
	systems. Where <a class="footnote">Personal Data<span>That
	    is, data that personally identifies a single person in
	    question (in this case, you). For instance, your name, email
	    address, or credit card details.</span></a> is collected by
	us, it will be transmitted and protected via a secure
	protocol and encrypted in our databases to be accessed only
	as stated above. If and when we use subcontractors or
	service providers to store your data, we will not relinquish
	control of your <a class="footnote">Personal Data<span>That
	    is, data that personally identifies the person in question
	    (in this case, you). For instance, your name, email address,
	    or credit card details.</span></a> or expose it to security
	risks that would not have arisen had the data remained in
	our possession.</p>
      <p><b>However, no transmission of data over the internet is
	  guaranteed to be completely secure.</b> It may be possible for
	third parties not under our control to intercept or access
	transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we
	strive to protect your <a class="footnote">Personal Data<span>That
	    is, data that personally identifies the person in question (in
	    this case, you). For instance, your name, email address, or credit
	    card details.</span></a>, we cannot ensure or warrant the security
	of any <a class="footnote">Personal Data<span>That is, data that
	    personally identifies the person in question (in this case,
	    you). For instance, your name, email address, or credit card
	    details.</span></a> you transmit to us. Any such transmission is
	done at your own risk. If you believe that your interaction with
	us is no longer secure, please <a class="a-link"
