     Legalese, a deep-tech remote-first LegalTech company, has positions
     open for junior developers. The career path progresses to full-stack
     developer, team lead, PM (product / program / project manager), and
     eventually VP of Engineering.

     Our stack (you don't need to know them all already):
     - Typescript / Javascript, Node, React, Express. JSON, REST APIs. It's a web app.
     - AWS, S3, EC2, ECS, SimpleDB, Cloudwatch, Lambda.
     - Some Python; but if you know Ruby or Node or Perl, that's good enough.
     - Linux, Docker, Debian / Ubuntu / Centos. Nginx.
     - Git. Opensource community participation. A bit of SQL.
     - Emacs, but you can use your preferred editor, as long as you're not coding in Notepad.
     - Google Apps. A touch of Microsoft Word, strictly for client work.

     Anything on this list that you don't already know, we will give you an
     opportunity to learn!

     Your stack: (some of this might be who you are; some might be who you want to grow into)
     - by temperament, you enjoy technical challenges. Your standard
     order of operations is to first try to solve problems on your own; then
     you look for help online; finally you ask a human. You'd be surprised
     how many people do the opposite.
     - for example, if you find yourself needing to reverse every line in a list of strings,
     you try to do it using the tools you already know, rather than going
     straight to Google and searching for an answer.

	      <p align="left">As CTO, Meng is the lead systems architect, computer scientist, and
		resident good cop at Legalese. Twenty years ago, while working during the first wave of Internet startups, he
		created and led the anti-spam standard SPF to worldwide
		adoption. He's purportedly a
		lot wiser and more experienced now, so he wants to do the same and bring
		Legalese's L4 to worldwide adoption. This time, with a revenue model.</p><br>
	      
	      <h4 div class ="profiles-tldr">Long Version</h4>
	      <p align="left"><b>Emails &amp; first startup</b><br>
		In 1995, as a CS undergrad at the University of
		Pennsylvania, Meng co-founded <a class="a-link"
						 href="http://pobox.com"
						 target="_blank">pobox.com</a>, the first commercial
		email service (later acquired by Fastmail). A
		couple of years later, he created an anti-spam email standard
		(<a class="a-link"
		    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework"
		    target="_blank">RFC4408 SPF</a>) and led it
		to <b>global adoption</b>, by championing it to Microsoft, Google, Hotmail, and others.
		<b>Today, SPF protects a majority of all email.</b>
		The <a class="a-link"
		       href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/02/AR2005070201360.html"
		       target="_blank">Washington Post did a piece</a> on it.<br><br>
		
		<b>2nd Startup</b><br>
		In 2005, Meng
		co-founded <a class="a-link"
			      href="http://karmasphere.com"
			      target="_blank">karmasphere.com</a>, one of
		the <b>first big data analytics solutions</b> to
		deliver internet-scale “reputation data as a
		service”. This evolved to offer Big Data tools and
		was acquired by FICO.<br><br>

		<b>Singapore &amp; the 3rd Startup</b><br> In
		2008, Meng returned home to Singapore (after 20
		years away) for family reasons.  He missed the
		Valley. So, first, he co-founded <b>Hackerspace.SG</b>,
		one of the first maker spaces in Singapore. Then,
		bonding over <em>I'm OK, You're OK</em> with his soon-to-be cofounder, Hugh Mason, they
		founded <b>JFDI.Asia, Singapore's first startup
		  accelerator</b>. The amount of legal and
		quasi-legal documentation Meng had to deal with
		(not always successfully) at JFDI led Meng to put on his
		programmer hat for a couple of days and hack
		together what would later become v1 of Legalese.
		<br><br>
		Meng's background in innovation is informed by
		Everett Rogers, Geoffrey Moore, Clayton
		Christensen, William Janeway, Mariana Mazzucato,
		and Simon Wardley; by sitting on a variety of
		government panels in Singapore, most recently on
		the Committee for the Future Economy's
		subcommittee on Future Corporate Capabilities and
		Innovation (Startups); and by investing (direct and indirectly) in over 70
		startups. He hopes that Legalese, as a deep-tech startup based in Singapore, will
		answer some of the questions he keeps getting
		("<em>what would it take for Singapore to grow
		  the next unicorn?</em>", "<em>why is our R&amp;D not
		  yielding the results we expected?</em>"). Other questions,
		like "<em>are you Batman?</em>", he'll never
		answer. <br><br>

		<p>As cofounder and CEO of Legalese, Alexis's job description is

		  and established conventions and practices (i.e. horror stories) with the
		  engineering and product teams. She is known to sometimes style herself as
		  Alexis N. Chun in the well-honed tradition of Iain M. Banks.</p><br>

		<h4 div class ="profiles-tldr">Long Version</h4>
		<p>Alexis spends her days exorcising legal demons and
		  unlearning her bad habits. Mostly, she tries to get
		  things off the research team's plates so they can focus
		  on the hard stuff. That can be anything from writing
		  about and for Legalese, pitching to anyone who will listen,
		  convincing governments and companies to give us
		  money, answer product / industry questions,
		  managing the community, and putting her natural assets
		  (<a class="a-link"
		      href="http://www.lmfgtfy.com/?q=rbf" target="_blank">RBF</a>) to good
		  use, by playing bad cop to Meng's good cop within the
		  company. A little more self-interestedly, she does all this
                  so she won't have to wait too long to become the
		  first L4 legal programmer.<br><br>

		  In her previous life, she first got <a class="footnote">lulled by the
		    giant payout of being a corporate lawyer<span>(she trained in corporate law
		      at TSMP Law Corporation, a boutique Singaporean law firm that boasted
		      the highest starting salary)</span></a>, before moving on to a '<em>Big 4</em>'
		  experience with Rajah &amp; Tann where she continued her training and later
		  practised as an IP, IT, and commercial litigator. <a class="footnote">(Customary thank yous are footnoted here)<span>To <b> TSMP</b>, she is
		      grateful for the character building and for having imbued her with a
		      love of elegant drafting.<br><br> To <b>Rajah &amp; Tann</b>, she is grateful for the
		      wide scope of work, secondment opportunities (BNP Paribas;&nbsp;
		      JPMorgan), and for having always fed her like French royalty.</span></a>
		  Fortunately, none of the profession's razzle dazzle was enough to disabuse her of her mounting
		  suspicions that <b>the legal profession has neither the tools, math,
		    nor systems needed to solve its problems</b>. Her then-covert
		  explorations in the tech industry led her to OKCupid, which eventually
		  led her to Meng. Long story short: &nbsp; They met, he proposed, and 1 month later
		  she quit her job to become co-founder of Legalese. (Technically, he formally proposed only 3 months after,
		  to which she might have reacted with a mild aneurysm and let a fumey fart escape whilst fully personifying the "???" thought bubble)<br><br>
		  
		  Alexis unschooled herself for secondary school in Singapore
		  (preferring instead to hole up in her bedroom discovering music,
		  films, and books), and is a proud alumna of Victoria Junior College. She's grateful that you read this far, but recommends that you
		  read any other section of the website instead (she put a lot of work into that). Or even
		  better, read Diamond Age. When she grows up, she'd rather like to be a
		  monster mash of Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Lyra Silvertongue, Ursula K Le Guin, Nell, Karen Teoh, and Amanda
		  Palmer.</p>

		  <p>Dustin is a computer scientist with a <b>three peat

		    Essentially, this means that he spends a great deal of time

		    scientist wannabes) in the team, and exercising his

		  <p>Prior to Legalese, he founded <a class="a-link"

					  target="_blank">Dustin's PhD thesis</a> (which was completed under the

		    advocates leveraging the high standards of formal deductive

		    fundamental sources of disagreement, <em>whilst</em> avoiding flawed

		  <h4 class ="profiles-tldr">TL;DR</h4>
		  <p>The self-taught web developer at Legalese who is super relieved that he gets to deal with code and computers instead of having to actually become a lawyer (he'd met Alexis and her horror stories worked wonders on him). Law school was boring enough.</p><br> 
		  <h4 class ="profiles-tldr">Long Version</h4>
		  <p>Yes, it's from that book and person in the bible. His
		    parents are religious; he no longer is.<br><br>
		    The <a class="footnote">self-taught web
		      developer<span>though to be fair, he did attend a GA webdev course, but in his words, found it completely useless and preferred reading on his own instead</span></a>at Legalese deals with the practical side of
		    Legalese's product. This includes front-end work,
		    deployment, and all the other needs of a modern web
		    application. After studying four years of law, he
		    decided that the subject had turned his brain into mush,
		    and thus is now rehabilitating himself with the more
		    energetic environs of programming. But for Alexis's proclaimation that he is "too smart to be a real lawyer", he might have been peer and family pressured into Big Law. Boy, did he dodge one.<br><br>
		    Job has one of the
		    most enviable memory capacities of the team, is
		    always first pick at trivia games, and a very avid reader. Somehow, he still manages to find time to
		    play and watch DOTA 2, enjoy movies, and develop an
		    opinion on music. He is occasionally (affectionately) teased
		    for being from the <a class="a-link"
					  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gifted_Education_Programme_(Singapore)"
					  target="_blank">Gifted Education Programme</a> (where
		    kids scoring amongst the top 1% of tested IQ are
		    recruited for special education) because he's often 3 steps ahead of everyone and doesn't like writing documentation. He comforts the rest of us by
		    pointing out that Meng was in it when it was designed for those in the top 0.25%, and if Meng can learn to write documentation and wait for the rest of us, so can he.<br><br>
